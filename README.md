and Vanilla JavaScript**.\
This app supports real-time mathematical expression evaluation,
including operations with precedence,\
and provides a clean, responsive, and interactive interface.

Designed for both learning and practical use. ✨

    Multiplication, Division\
-   🧾 Supports **operator precedence** using infix → postfix
    evaluation\
-   📐 Includes **exponentiation (\^)**\
-   ⏱️ Real-time evaluation of expressions\

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **HTML5** -- App structure\
-   **CSS3** -- Styling (responsive layout, grid system, UI effects)\
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** -- Core logic (expression parsing,
    infix-to-postfix conversion, evaluation)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 How it Works

1.  User enters an expression using calculator buttons.\
2.  Input is displayed on the **screen** in real-time.\
3.  When **=** is pressed:
    -   The expression is converted from **infix to postfix**.\
    -   The postfix expression is evaluated using a stack.\
    -   The result is displayed.\
4.  **C** clears the screen.\
5.  **x** deletes the last entered character.
